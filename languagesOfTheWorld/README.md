Mapping [Glottolog](http://glottolog.org) data. My thanks to Harald Hammarstr√∂m and Robert Forkel for their help in obtaining the data from Glottolog's API.

### Data collection

1. Required Python package: `pandas` for Py data frames;
2. Run `python fetchGlottologData.py` to fetch 'languoid' data from the API (you are collecting all 'language' resources: 7943 as of last fetch on 2019-01-07; this can be changed via the URLs in `glottologJSONfetch.py`), saves output to `data` dir as csv file (this all takes a while, put the kettle on for a cuppa!);


### Shiny App

1. Contained in `glottologDataExplorer.R`: single file Shiny app.
2. Required R packages: `shiny`, `leaflet`, and dependencies

- For more info on Shiny, see http://shiny.rstudio.com
- For more info on Leaflet, see http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet

To run locally, change to the `shinyApp' directory, open R and --
```
library(shiny)
runApp('gde_prod.R')
```

To deploy to shinyapps.io, you'll need to set up and configure your [shinyapps](http://www.shinyapps.io) account, then --
`Required packages: rsconnect` (latter 2 via `devtools`: `devtools::install_github('rstudio/rsconnect')`)
```
library(rsconnect)
deployApp(appPrimaryDoc='gde_prod.R', appName='langmap')
# i.e. https://cainesap.shinyapps.io/langmap
```
